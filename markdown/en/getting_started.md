## Install and Run

This is how you can install muta on your own operating system. If you want to try muta via docker quickly, you can check [use docker](#use-docker) first.

### Install Dependencies

#### MacOS

```
brew install autoconf libtool
```

#### ubuntu

```
apt update
apt install -y git curl openssl cmake pkg-config libssl-dev gcc build-essential clang libclang-dev
```

#### centos7

```
yum install -y centos-release-scl
yum install -y git make gcc-c++ openssl-devel llvm-toolset-7

# enable llvm
scl enable llvm-toolset-7 bash
```

#### archlinux

```
pacman -Sy --noconfirm git gcc pkgconf clang make
```

### Download Pre-compiled Binary
 
We will publish the binary files for some common operating system on [github releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/muta/releases). 
If your system is in the list, you can download the file directly.
 
### Compile From Source Code

#### Get Source Code

Get source code via git:

```
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/muta.git
```

Or download the source package on [github releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/muta/releases).

#### Install Rust

referenceï¼š <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Compile

```
cd /path/to/muta
make prod
```

The compiled binary path is `target/release/muta-chain`.

### Run Single Node Chain

```
cd /path/to/muta

# run muta with default config
# if you downloaded the binary instead of compiling it yourself, you should change the path to your binary path
./target/release/muta-chain

# print help information
$ ./target/release/muta-chain  -h
Muta v0.1.0
Muta Dev <muta@nervos.org>

USAGE:
    muta-chain [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <FILE>     a required file for the configuration [default: ./devtools/chain/config.toml]
    -g, --genesis <FILE>    a required file for the genesis json [default: ./devtools/chain/genesis.json]
```

### Run Multiple Nodes Chain

1. Modify the `config.toml` according to your network topology. Pay attention to the `privkey`, `network` and `verifier_list` part. You can refer the docker-compose config or read the config reference below.
2. Release your binary file, config.toml and genesis.json to you node machines.
3. Start the bootstrap nodes.
4. Start the other nodes.

## Use Docker

```
docker run -it --init -p 8000:8000 nervos/muta

# if you want to keep the chain data, you can mount the data diretory to the host machine
docker run -it --init -p 8000:8000 -v `pwd`/data:/app/devtools/chain/data nervos/muta
```
 
Visit [graphiql](http://localhost:8000/graphiql) to interact with your chain!

 
Use docker compose to run multiple nodes chain:

```
docker-compose -f devtools/docker/dockercompose/docker-compose-bft.yaml up
```

This config start 4 nodes, and the chain data path is `target/data/bft1` ~ `target/data/bft4`.
You can check `docker-compose-bft.yaml` for more details.
 
## Config Reference

The default config sample is located at `./devtools/chain/config.toml`.
There are some comments below.
